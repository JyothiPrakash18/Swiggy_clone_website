This project is a complete Swiggy clone built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). The application includes user authentication, form validation, and other essential features to simulate a food delivery service. Users can add items to their cart. Authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). A loader is available and activates when the page is refreshed and fontawesome is used for icons.
